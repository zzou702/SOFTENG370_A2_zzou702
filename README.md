To run the sync program, first you need to give the makefile excutable permission: 

run "chmod +x makefile"

Then run the makefile:
"./makefile"

The previous command should have created a "sync" file that you can execute

To run the sync file, run:
./sync directory1 directory2 

The contents in the directories will be synced.

Note: this is my first python program with no prior knowledge/experience with python, the program is inefficient and possesses code smells. But I think this gives an idea of my ability to learn new things.
